# My new project using Tableau


I was able to make Dashboard clearly through it

• The airport where flights are delayed from arrival time

• The airport that arrives on time without delay or advance time

• What is the most airline that makes flights during the year and through the slicer you can filter according to the month and day

• I was also able to find out what pattern the flights are traveling with during the 12 months of the year, and which days have the most number of flights and the days in which there are fewer flights.

• What is the city with the most number of flights?

• The reasons for choosing each chart and choosing the appropriate design are also explained.
